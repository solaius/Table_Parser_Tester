## Detailed Analysis of Table Transformer Implementation

### Current Implementation

The Table Transformer extractor uses a two-step approach:
1. **Table Detection**: Uses Microsoft's table-transformer-detection model to identify table regions in the PDF
2. **Text Extraction**: Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from the detected table cells

The implementation includes:
- PDF to image conversion using pdf2image
- Table detection using the DETR-based transformer model
- Cell detection using contour analysis with OpenCV
- Text extraction using Tesseract OCR with multiple preprocessing techniques

### OCR Preprocessing Techniques

The current implementation tries multiple preprocessing techniques to improve OCR accuracy:
1. Original image
2. Grayscale conversion
3. Binary thresholding (black text on white background)
4. Inverted binary thresholding (white text on black background)
5. Adaptive thresholding
6. Image resizing (2x upscaling)

### Issues and Limitations

1. **Table Structure Detection**:
   - The model generally detects tables correctly but struggles with identifying cell boundaries
   - The contour-based cell detection is not always accurate, especially for complex tables

2. **OCR Quality**:
   - Text extraction results are completely off
   - Some cells return placeholder coordinates instead of actual text
   - Character recognition accuracy is far lower than expected

## Next Steps for Improvement
